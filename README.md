How to download the PyVHR python environment?

1) Follow the link https://github.com/phuselab/pyVHR/tree/pyVHR_CPU, and make sure you are downloading the right branch of the code, namely "pyVHR_CPU" (NOT "Master").
2) Go through the README.md file to create the environment, BUT don't use the 'pyVHR_CPU_env.yml' file to install the required packages. Instead, use the updated version  'cpu_pyvhr.yml', found in this 'rPPG_TruncatedSVD' github repository, under https://github.com/giaaisgiaa/rPPG_TruncatedSVD.
3) Now that you have pyVHR installed, you can run the 'SVD_vs_TSVD' notebook under the "Notebooks" folder.
